usecases:
- As a web application developer, I want to deliver updates in a seamless way,
  after the user visit the application next time.
- As a user, I don't want to wait for the new version to be installed, I always
  want the latest version available.

<p>When your users visit your web, they are not prompted with a request to update,
they simply see you brand new awesome UI with all the new functionality after
the next visit. Progressive Web Applications behave exactly the same by default
but they offer much more flexibility so if you prefer to prompt, you can do it.</p>
