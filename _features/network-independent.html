description: Work offline or on low quality networks.
usecases:
- As a user, I want to revisit a site and get its contents even if no network is available.
- As a user, I want to browse any kind of content I visited at least once, even under situations of poor connectivity.
- As a developer, in situations with no connectivity, I want to control what is shown to the user.
technologies:
- service-workers
- app-shell

<p>Progressive Web Apps can work even on lack of network or unreliable connectivity. No more blank connectivity error pages nor dinosaurs running through the desert. A clear separation between UI and content in addition to offline caches and service workers allow you to store the application layout for future use.</p>
