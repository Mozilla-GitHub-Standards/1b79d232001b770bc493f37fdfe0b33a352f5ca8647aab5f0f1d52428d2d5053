<p>As soon as you start writing progressive web apps, you want the world to
  know about them. If a user visits your app in a modern browser, all your
  website's progressive super-powers simply emerge, but <em>what if the user
  never heard about you?</em> Progressive Web Applications are discoverable
  because they allow search engines and Web indexes to identify your application and
  highlight its capabilities.</p>
